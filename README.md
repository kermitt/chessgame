Making a UI to show influence and both white and black POV.

# Running
Currently this is a standalone thing.<br>
To run, it needs a webserver...   <br>
I like to use a simple python thing such as <br>
python -m http.server 3030 ( for python 2.x ) <br> 
or <br>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3030 ( for python 3.x )  <br> 
<br>
Running with that port would make this available at: http://localhost:3030/six.html<br>
